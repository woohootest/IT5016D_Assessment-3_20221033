    # Avoid creating infinite loops. These can cause a program to stall. Infinite loops are also difficult to test.
    # Use i, j and k as variables in from statements. This is a coding convention recognised by experienced developers
    # Use the "from element in list:" syntax to search for an item in a list. This approach avoids the error that might occur if the item being searched for doesn't exist in the list
    # Use lists for most applications. Remember that tuples are immutable, and should only be used where the requirement is for a collection to be unchangeable
    # Always write container elements on new lines. This makes the code easier to read.
