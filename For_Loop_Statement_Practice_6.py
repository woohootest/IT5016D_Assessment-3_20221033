# Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Note : An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

print("Input lengths of the triangle sides: ")
x = int(input("x: "))
y = int(input("y: "))
z = int(input("z: "))

if x == y == z:
	print("Equilateral triangle")
elif x==y or y==z or z==x:
	print("isosceles triangle")
else:
	print("Scalene triangle")
