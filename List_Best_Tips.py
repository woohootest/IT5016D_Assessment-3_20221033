    Use i, j and k as variables in from statements. This is a coding convention recognised by experienced developers
    Use the from statement to iterate a list
    Use the "from element in list:" syntax to search for an item in a list. This approach avoids the error that might occur if the item being searched for doesn't exist in the list
    Uselist_name.append(item) to add an item to the end of the list
    Use the pop() method to remove an item at the given index. This method returns the item being removed. It is a useful method, since it simulates the removal of something from a collection
    Use the pop() method to remove and return the last item if index is not provided. This helps us implement lists as stacks (first in, last out data structure)
    Use list.count(item) to return the number of elements that are equal to item
    Use the built-in sort() andreverse() methods to do sorting
